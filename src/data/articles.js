					<div className="paragraph">Cloud Computing is on-demand access, via the internet, to computing resources-applications, servers (physical and virtual servers), data storage, development tools, networking capabilities, and more-hosted at a remote data center managed by a Cloud Service Provider (CSP).

Instead of keeping files on a proprietary hard drive or local storage device, cloud-based storage makes it possible to save them to a remote database. In other words, we can say, it is the delivery of on-demand computing services-from applications to storage and processing power, typically over the internet. The cloud service provider makes these resources available for a monthly subscription fee on a pay-as-you-go basis.
